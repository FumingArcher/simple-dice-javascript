# simple-dice-javascript
I made a very simple dice roll using javascript functions. 
I will probably expand on this in the future and make it look more appealing when I learn more javascript. 
For now it is just a blank page, with a "roll dice" button and 3 values marked x, y and z.
In order for the button to function I used a .onclick functionality where upon a click, the code will generate a random number from 1-6 via the Math.random functionality. Then I used .innerHTML in order to
transform the empty labels into their respective values, x, y and z.
